# DSCI 561: Regression I

Inference on a numeric response, in the presence of predictors.


## Course Learning Outcomes

By the end of the course, students are expected to:

- Fit a linear regression model using R and `broom`.
- Interpret how predictors influence a response using a fitted linear regression model.
- Identify whether a linear regression model is appropriate for a given dataset.
- Identify use cases of linear regression
- Evaluate the fit of a regression model using residual plots
- Evaluate the fit of a regression model using appropriate measures of model goodness (MSE and R-squared), and drawing the connection back to the null model. 
- Quantify estimation error vs. prediction error in the presence of predictors, and understand the decomposition of error in each case. 
- Understand the effect of multicollinearity on an OLS estimate.
- Convert categorical predictors for use in a linear regression model.
